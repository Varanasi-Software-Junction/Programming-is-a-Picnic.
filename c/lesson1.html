        <h1>Introduction to Programming and C</h1>

        <p>Programming is a fundamental skill in the modern world, and the <strong>C programming language</strong> is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in learning how to code. C is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency, making it a powerful tool in both system and application development.</p>

        <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
        <p>At its core, <strong>programming</strong> is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions, written in a <strong>programming language</strong>, tell the computer how to perform specific tasks such as calculating numbers, storing data, or interacting with hardware.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Program</strong>: A set of instructions written by a programmer.</li>
            <li><strong>Programming language</strong>: A formal language used to communicate with the computer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are many programming languages, but <strong>C</strong> stands out due to its ability to produce high-performance programs and its widespread use in various domains, from operating systems to embedded systems.</p>

        <!-- Image: Flowchart of programming process -->

        <h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
        <p>The C programming language has been around since the early 1970s and is still widely used today. Here are several reasons why learning C is beneficial:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: C produces highly efficient code, which is critical for performance-intensive applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation for Other Languages</strong>: Many popular languages, such as <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, derive syntax and concepts from C.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-Level Access</strong>: C allows direct access to memory and system resources, making it ideal for systems programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong>: Programs written in C can be easily compiled and run on different types of computers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Evolution of C Programming</h2>
        <p>C was developed by <strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong> at Bell Labs in 1972 as an enhancement to the <strong>B language</strong>, which was itself a simplified version of <strong>BCPL</strong>. C’s design was based on these earlier languages but introduced features like <strong>data types</strong>, <strong>structs</strong>, and <strong>pointers</strong>.</p>

        <p>C gained immense popularity for its portability across various platforms, becoming the foundation for the <strong>UNIX</strong> operating system. Over time, it became the standard in systems programming and is now widely used for developing <strong>operating systems</strong>, <strong>compilers</strong>, <strong>device drivers</strong>, and <strong>embedded systems</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up the C Programming Environment</h2>
        <p>Before you can begin coding in C, you need to set up the programming environment on your machine. The most common tools for writing and compiling C programs are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text Editor</strong>: A simple editor like <strong>Notepad++</strong>, <strong>Sublime Text</strong>, or an Integrated Development Environment (<strong>IDE</strong>) such as <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>, <strong>Eclipse</strong>, or <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Compiler</strong>: A compiler translates the C code into machine language. Popular compilers include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)</strong> for Linux and macOS.</li>
                    <li><strong>MinGW</strong> for Windows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clang</strong> for cross-platform development.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Terminal/Command Prompt</strong>: This is where you'll run the commands to compile and execute your C programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Set Up:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Install an IDE</strong>: Download and install an IDE like <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> or <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Install a Compiler</strong>: Install <strong>GCC</strong> or <strong>MinGW</strong> based on your operating system.</li>
            <li><strong>Configure the IDE</strong>: Ensure the IDE is set up to use the compiler correctly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Understanding a Simple C Program</h2>
        <p>Let’s walk through a simple C program to understand its structure. Below is a basic “Hello, World!” program:</p>

        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;   // Preprocessor directive to include standard input/output library

int main() {         // Main function where the program execution begins
    printf("Hello, World!");  // Print function to display text on the screen
    return 0;        // Return 0 to indicate that the program finished successfully
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Key components of a C program:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preprocessor Directives</strong>: Lines that start with <code>#</code>, like <code>#include</code>, tell the compiler to include files or libraries before compiling the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Function</strong>: The <code>main()</code> function is where the execution of any C program starts. It’s mandatory in every C program.</li>
            <li><strong>Statements</strong>: Each line inside the <code>main()</code> function is a statement. The statement <code>printf("Hello, World!");</code> tells the program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.</li>
            <li><strong>Return 0</strong>: This indicates the program has successfully executed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basic Structure of a C Program</h2>
        <p>A C program follows a specific structure, divided into the following sections:</p>

        <h3>1. Preprocessor Directives</h3>
        <p>These are lines that begin with the <code>#</code> symbol, like <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, and are processed before the actual compilation begins. This section is used to include libraries or define macros.</p>

        <h3>2. Global Declarations</h3>
        <p>Variables or functions declared here are accessible throughout the program.</p>

        <h3>3. Main Function</h3>
        <p>The <code>main()</code> function is the entry point for the program. Every C program must have one main function where the program begins execution.</p>

        <h3>4. Other Functions</h3>
        <p>Additional user-defined functions can be created to divide complex tasks into smaller, reusable pieces of code.</p>

        <h2>Compiling and Running a C Program</h2>
        <p>Once you’ve written a C program, you need to <strong>compile</strong> it into <strong>machine code</strong> that the computer can execute. The basic steps are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Write the program</strong>: Write your C program in a text editor or IDE.</li>
            <li><strong>Compile the program</strong>: Use a compiler like GCC. The command to compile a file named <code>hello.c</code> is:
                <pre><code>gcc hello.c -o hello</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Run the program</strong>: Execute the compiled program:
                <pre><code>./hello</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Image: Diagram showing code compilation process -->

        <h2>Tokens, Characters, Identifiers, and Literals</h2>
        <p>In C programming, the smallest individual units in a program are called <strong>tokens</strong>. Let's explore these essential components:</p>

        <h3>1. Tokens in C</h3>
        <p>A <strong>token</strong> is the smallest element in a C program that has meaning. C programs consist of various types of tokens such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keywords</strong>: Reserved words like <code>int</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifiers</strong>: User-defined names for variables, functions, arrays, etc. (e.g., <code>age</code>, <code>main</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Constants/Literals</strong>: Fixed values that do not change during execution (e.g., <code>25</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>'A'</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Operators</strong>: Symbols that perform operations like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Symbols</strong>: Characters such as <code>{</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>;</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Identifiers in C</h3>
        <p>An <strong>identifier</strong> is the name given to variables, functions, arrays, etc. Identifiers must follow specific rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They can contain letters, digits, and underscores.</li>
            <li>They must begin with a letter or underscore.</li>
            <li>They are case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>They cannot be a keyword (e.g., <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Literals in C</h3>
        <p><strong>Literals</strong>, also known as constants, are fixed values used in programs. C supports several types of literals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Integer literals</strong>: Whole numbers (e.g., <code>10</code>, <code>255</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Floating-point literals</strong>: Decimal numbers (e.g., <code>3.14</code>, <code>6.022</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Character literals</strong>: Single characters enclosed in single quotes (e.g., <code>'A'</code>, <code>'1'</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>String literals</strong>: Sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., <code>"Hello, World!"</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Image: Diagram showing different types of tokens -->

        <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>There are several types of programming languages, each serving different purposes. The classification of languages includes:</p>

        <h3>1. Machine Language</h3>
        <p><strong>Machine language</strong> consists of binary code (1s and 0s) that the computer’s hardware can execute directly. It is the lowest-level language, specific to each computer’s architecture, and very difficult for humans to write.</p>

        <h3>2. Assembly Language</h3>
        <p><strong>Assembly language</strong> is a step above machine language and uses symbolic code (mnemonics) like <code>MOV</code>, <code>ADD</code>, and <code>SUB</code>. Assembly languages are machine-dependent, meaning they are specific to the hardware of the system they are running on.</p>

        <h3>3. Low-Level Languages</h3>
        <p><strong>Low-level languages</strong> include machine and assembly languages. These languages provide direct access to the hardware, giving the programmer complete control over memory and hardware interactions. They are often used in system programming, such as writing operating systems and device drivers.</p>

        <h3>4. High-Level Languages</h3>
        <p><strong>High-level languages</strong> (HLLs) are designed to be easy for humans to read and write. These languages are more abstract than low-level languages and handle much of the hardware complexity. Popular high-level languages include C, C++, Java, and Python. They are portable across platforms, unlike low-level languages.</p>

        <h3>5. Compiler and Interpreter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compiler</strong>: A <strong>compiler</strong> translates the entire source code of a program into machine code before execution. C is a compiled language, meaning the entire C program is converted into machine code that the computer executes.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpreter</strong>: An <strong>interpreter</strong> translates code into machine code line by line at runtime. Languages like Python use interpreters, allowing immediate execution of code without a separate compilation step.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this chapter, we introduced the basic concepts of <strong>programming</strong>, explored the structure of a <strong>C program</strong>, discussed fundamental elements such as <strong>tokens, identifiers, and literals</strong>, and covered the different types of <strong>programming languages</strong> like machine, assembly, low-level, and high-level languages. We also touched upon the role of <strong>compilers</strong> and <strong>interpreters</strong> in translating code for execution.</p>

        <p>In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into the syntax of C and how to write more complex programs using operators and control structures.</p>
